# Alias Command Tool

Alias Command Tool is a command-line utility that allows you to define and execute command aliases at the directory level. This tool reads aliases from a configuration file (`r.config.json`) and provides an easy way to run complex commands with simple aliases. It also supports redirecting command output to the terminal and includes an in-memory caching mechanism with a short TTL to improve performance.

## Features

-   Define and execute command aliases at the directory level.
-   Automatically redirect command output to the terminal.

## Installation

To install the Alias Command Tool globally, run:

```sh
npm install -g alias-cmd
```
